 * shutdowns that is not uncommon in AWS environments.
 *
 * If a lease elapses without renewals, it will eventually expire consequently
 * marking the associated {@link T} for immediate eviction - this is similar to
 * an explicit cancellation except that there is no communication between the
 * {@link T} and {@link LeaseManager}.
